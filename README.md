# Power-BI---Retail-Data
You have been provided with retail data; the data are in 4 disparate files. Your eventual goal is to 
make a high level dashboard with different cuts, and some insights. As a first step, you need to get 
all 4 tables in your data model and ensure the relationships between the tables are well defined for 
further use. You are also required to add some fields in the data - to enable the different views - Net 
Units, Weekday vs Weekend performance, etc.
